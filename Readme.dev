Future Improvements
===================

  The following lists possible improvements/new features. These may or may not ever happen.

  - Allow app to run in exclusive or exclusive auto modes
  - Allow custom buttons to start a specified playlist e.g renamed F1..F14
  - Make fast fwd/rewind stop occuring when the release event occurs (assuming this is
    sufficiently exposed by HID remote)


How It Works
============

  The Apple IR remote only has 6 buttons although each has a hold action giving
  12 unique commands. In addition each apple remote can be assigned a remote ID
  between 0 and 255 which is sent along with the IR command.

  The "plex/plex player" device in the logitech harmony one DB takes advantage of
  this to map multiple remote IDs onto the same remote, in effect providing 
  more than 12 unique commands.

  Unfortunatly iTunes and other apps will ignore the remote ID and respond to 
  each of the "different" play commands the same.

  For example, with the default mapping, OK and Stop are set to send:

    Button  -  Remote ID  -  IR Code
    OK      -  150        -  5
    Stop    -  151        -  5

  So even though this app can ignore button codes for remoteIDs it has no interest
  in, itunes will still react to them. For now, the workaround if for the app to
  take exclusive control over the IR remote.


Default Plex Mappings
=====================
  
  By default the plex player device in the logitech DB is configured to use the following
  remote ID and button code pairs.
  
  Menu      150   6
  Exit      155   1
  Info      153   1
  Giude     157   5
  Up Arrow  158   1
  Dn Arrow  158   2

  more to follow.
  

Default Apple Mappings
======================

  The Apple IR remote uses the following codes (remote ID can be between 0..255)
  
  Up             1
  Down           2
  Left           3
  Right          4
  Ok             5
  Menu           6
  Play/Pause     7
  
  For the hold code, add 65536 to the above codes. i.e Up becomes 65537
