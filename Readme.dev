Future Improvements
===================

  The following lists possible improvements/new features. These may or may not ever happen.

  - Allow app to run in exclusive or exclusive auto modes
  - Allow custom buttons to start a specified playlist e.g renamed F1..F14
  - Make fast fwd/rewind stop occuring when the release event occurs (assuming this is
    sufficiently exposed by HID remote)


How It Works
============

  The Apple IR remote only has 6 buttons although each has a hold action giving
  12 unique commands. In addition each apple remote can be assigned a remote ID
  between 0 and 255 which is sent along with the IR command.

  The "plex/plex player" device in the logitech harmony one DB takes advantage of
  this to map multiple remote IDs onto the same remote, in effect providing 
  more than 12 unique commands.

  Unfortunatly iTunes and other apps will ignore the remote ID and respond to 
  each of the "different" play commands the same.

  For example, with the default mapping, OK and Stop are set to send:

    Button  -  Remote ID  -  IR Code
    OK      -  150        -  5
    Stop    -  151        -  5

  So even though this app can ignore button codes for remoteIDs it has no interest
  in, itunes will still react to them. For now, the workaround if for the app to
  take exclusive control over the IR remote.


Default Plex Mappings
=====================
  
  If you're configuring a different smart remote that can send Apple IR
  remoteID/button codes combinations, use the following codes:

  Button    Remote ID   Code
  Info      153         1
  1         151         1
  2         151         2
  3         151         3
  4         151         4
  5         152         3
  Ok        150         5 


  Although not used currently by this app, the following is a complete list of the plex
  remote/code mappings in the Harmony One DB.
