About irMusic
=============

  irMusic works in conjunction with a smart remote such as the Logitech Harmony
  One which can emulate several Apple IR remotes. The basic play/pause/skip/stop
  functionality will control iTunes as normal, however, additional buttons such
  as 1..5 will rate the currently playing track and the "info" button will speak the
  current track rating.


Remote Setup
============

  Add a new device using "media center PC", plex, plex player with a suitable
  name e.g "Plex Mac Mini"

  The default bindings are suitable for controlling plex, but will need remapping
  for iTunes control. 

  Create a new activity (note some steps may differ depending on whether you
  use an AV Receiver or not):
     No - manually add an activity to my setup
     Listen to music
     Listen to Digital Music
     Leave Listen to digital music checked.
     I use my Plex Mac Mini to play digital music
     I use my AV Receiver to control the volume
       VCR/DVR (or whatever input source mac is plugged into)
     Yes these settings are correct.
     Done

  Note, when using iTunes without this app running, you'll either need an activity
  setup to use the default apple IR settings (see logitech DB for mac mini) or
  use the dir right/left to skip and ok to play/pause.

  Running iTunes then this app should now allow both control of iTunes in a normal
  way as well as rating songs by pressing the buttons 1..5 on the remote.
 
  You may need to unpair any existing remote to allow multiple remote IDs to be
  used. However as of 10.8, even when a single remote is paired, any remote is able
  to control iTunes (bug?)

  You may also need to hit the OK button the first time the app runs before events
  will be recognised.

  This app is designed to work with the Harmoney One remote by Logitech using the
  Plex/Plex Player device and default mappings. Although other configurations may 
  work, they're unsupported. Feel free to experiment, but please don't complain if
  anything breaks.

  Please report any bugs or feature suggestions to gary@mups.co.uk
